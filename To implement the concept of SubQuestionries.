Creating clientmaster table from oldclient_master, table

Create table client_master
AS SELECT * FROM oldclient_master;

Using the Union, Intersect and Minus Clause:
Union Clause:
The user can put together multiple Questionries and combine their output using the union clause . The union clause merges the output of two or  more  Questionries into a single set of rows and column. The final output of union clause will be 

Output: = Records only in Questionry one + records only in Questionry two + A single set of  records with is common in the both Questionries.

Syntax:

SELECT columnname, columname
FROM tablename 1
UNION
SELECT columnname,  columnname
From tablename2;


Intersect Clause: The use can put together multiple Questionries and their output using the interest clause. The final output of the interest clause will be :

Output =A single set of records which are common in both Questionries

Syntax:
SELECT  columnname, columnname
FROM tablename 1
INTERSECT
SELECT columnname, columnname
FROM tablename 2;

MINUS CLAUSE:- The user can put together multiple Questionries and combine their output = records only in Questionry one
Syntax:
SELECT columnname, columnname
FROM tablename ;
MINUS
SELECT columnname, columnname
FROM tablename ;
