Objective:   Create tables and specify the Queries in SQL.

Theory & Concepts:

Introduction about SQL- 
 SQL (Structured Questionry Language) is a nonprocedural language, you specify what you want, not how to get it. A block structured format of English key words is used in this Questionry language. It has the following components.

DDL (Data Definition Language)- 
The SQL DDL provides command for defining relation schemas, deleting relations and modifying relation schema.

DML (DATA Manipulation Language)-
 It includes commands to insert tuples into, delete tuples from and modify tuples in the database.

View definition- 
The SQL DDL includes commands for defining views.
Transaction Control- SQL includes for specifying the beginning and ending of transactions.

Embedded SQL and Dynamic SQL-
 Embedded and Dynamic SQL define how SQL statements can be embedded with in general purpose programming languages, such as C, C++, JAVA, COBOL, Pascal and Fortran.

Integrity- 
The SQL DDL includes commands for specifying integrity constraints that the data stored in the database must specify. Updates that violate integrity constraints are allowed.

Authorization- 
The SQL DDL includes commands for specifying access rights to relations and views.


Data Definition Language- 

The SQL DDL allows specification of not only a set of relations but also information about each relation, including-
Schema for each relation
The domain of values associated with each attribute.
The integrity constraints.
The set of indices to be maintained for each relation.
The security and authorization information for each relation.
The physical storage structure of each relation on disk.


Domain types in SQL- 

The SQL standard supports a variety of built in domain types, including-
Char (n)- A fixed length character length string with user specified length .
Varchar (n)- A variable character length string with user specified maximum length n.
Int- An integer.
Small integer- A small integer.
Numeric (p, d)-A Fixed point number with user defined precision.
Real, double precision- Floating point and double precision floating point numbers with machine dependent precision.
Float (n)- A floating point number, with precision of at least n digits.
Date- A calendar date containing a (four digit) year, month and day of  the month.
Time- The time of day, in hours, minutes and seconds Eg. Time ’09:30:00’.
Number- Number is used to store numbers (fixed or floating point).

DDL statement for creating a table-

Syntax-
 Create table tablename
(columnname datatype(size),  columnname datatype(size));

Creating a table from a table-

Syntax-
 CREATE TABLE TABLENAME
[(columnname, columnname, ………)]
AS SELECT columnname, columnname……..FROM tablename;

Insertion of data into tables-

Syntax-
 INSERT INTO tablename
[(columnname, columnname, ………)]
Values(expression, expression);

Inserting data into a table from another table:

Syntax- 
INSERT INTO tablename
SELECT columnname, columnname, …….
FROM tablename;

Insertion of selected data into a table from another table:

Syntax-
 INSERT INTO tablename
SELECT columnname, columnname……..
FROM tablename
WHERE columnname= expression;

Retrieving of data from the tables-

Syntax-
 SELECT * FROM tablename;

The retrieving of specific columns from a table-

Syntax-
 SELECT  columnname, columnname, ….
FROM tablename;

Elimination of duplicates from the select statement-

Syntax- 
SELECT DISTINCT columnname, columnname
FROM tablename;

Selecting a data set from table data-

Syntax-
 SELECT columnname, columnname
FROM tablename
WHERE searchcondition;
