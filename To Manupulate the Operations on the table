 To Manupulate the Operations on the table.
DML ( Data Manipulation Language) Data manipulation is 

The retrieval of information stored in the database.
The insertion of new information into the database.
The deletion of information from the database.
The modification of information stored by the appropriate data model. There are basically two types.
Procedural DML:-  require a user to specify what data are  needed and how to get those data.
 Non Procedural DML : require a user to specify what data are needed without specifying how to get  those data.


Updating the content of a table:
In creation situation we may wish to change a value in table without changing all values in the tuple . For this purpose the update statement can be used.

Update table name
Set columnname = experision, columnname =expression……
Where columnname = expression;

Deletion Operation:-
 A delete reQuestionst is expressed in much the same way as Questionry. We can delete whole tuple ( rows) we can delete values on only particulars attributes.

Deletion  of all rows

Syntax:
Delete from tablename :

Deletion of specified number of rows
Syntax:

Delete from table name
Where search condition ;

Computation in expression lists used to select data

+ 	Addition		- Subtraction
*	multiplication		** exponentiation
/ Division			() Enclosed operation

Renaming columns used with Expression Lists: - The default output column names can be renamed by the user if required

Syntax:

Select column name 		result_columnname,
           Columnname		result_columnname,
From table name;

Logical Operators:
 The logical operators that can be used in SQL sentenced are

AND		all of must be included
OR		any of may be included
NOT		none of could be included

Range Searching: Between operation is used for range  searching.
Pattern Searching: 
The most commonly used operation on string is pattern matching using the operation ‘like’ we describe patterns by using two special characters.

Percent (%) ; the % character matches any substring we consider the following examples.
‘Perry %’ matches any string beginning with perry
‘% idge % matches any string containing’ idge as substring.
‘ - - - ‘ matches any string exactly three characters.
‘ - - - % matches any string of at least of three characters.
Oracle functions: 
Functions are used to manipulate data items and return result. function follow the format of function _name (argument1, argument2 ..) .An arrangement is user defined variable or constant. The structure of function is such that it accepts zero or more arguments.
Examples:
Avg		return average value of n

Syntax:
Avg ([distinct/all]n)
Min 		return minimum value of expr.

Syntax:
MIN((distict/all )expr)
Count		Returns the no of rows where expr is not null
Syntax:
Count ([distinct/all)expr]
Count (*) 	Returns the no rows in the table, including duplicates and those with nulls.
Max		 Return max value of expr

Syntax:
Max ([distinct/all]expr)
Sum 		Returns sum of values of n

Syntax:
 Sum ([distinct/all]n) 
Sorting of data in table
Syntax:
 Select columnname, columnname
From table
Order by columnname;
