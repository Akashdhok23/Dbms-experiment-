Objective:- To implement the concept of Indexes and views.
Indexes- An index is an ordered list of content of a column or group of columns in a table. An index created on the single column of the table is called simple index. When multiple table columns are included in the index it is called composite index.
Creating an Index for a table:-
Syntax (Simple)
			CREATE INDEX index_name
			ON tablename(column name);
Composite Index:-
			CREATE INDEX index_name
			ON tablename(columnname,columnname);
Creating an UniQuestion Index:-
			CREATE UNIQUESTION INDEX indexfilename
			ON tablename(columnname);
Dropping Indexes:-
			An index can be dropped by using DROP INDEX
SYNTAX:-	
			DROP INDEX indexfilename;
Views:-
		Logical data is how we want to see the current data in our database. Physical data is how this data is actually placed in our database.
		Views are masks placed upon tables. This allows the programmer to develop a method via which we can display predetermined data to users according to our desire.
		Views may be created fore the following reasons:

The DBA stores the views as a definition only. Hence there is no duplication of data.
Simplifies Questionries.
Can be Questionried as a base table itself.
Provides data security.
Avoids data redundancy.

Creation of Views:-
Syntax:-
		CREATE VIEW viewname AS
		SELECT columnname,columnname
		FROM tablename
		WHERE columnname=expression_list;

Renaming the columns of a view:-

Syntax:-
		CREATE VIEW viewname AS
		SELECT newcolumnnameâ€¦.
		FROM tablename
		WHERE columnname=expression_list;

Selecting a data set from a view-

Syntax:-
		SELECT columnname, columnname
		FROM viewname
		WHERE search condition;

Destroying a view-

Syntax:-
		DROP VIEW viewname;
